# Bamazon
An Amazon-like storefront that uses node to update the database in MySQL. It has two views as:

1. Customer's View:
The app will:
	a. display available products
	b. take in orders from customers and  
	c. deplete stock from the store's inventory. 


2. Manager's View:
The app will:
	a. confirm the manager with a password
	b. display available products
	c. display products with lower inventory (less than 200)
	d. add an entirely new product line(row)


Following is the link to the working video app:
